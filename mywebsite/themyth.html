        <h2 id="mythtitle">Explore the Timeless and Tragic Myth of Love</h2>
        <p id="firstonmyth">Our story begins with Orpheus, son of the God Apollo (better known as the messanger of the gods). Orpheus was given a lyre by Apollo 
            and soon Orpheus became the best player in all the land, with sounds that could charm the fiercest of enemies, and the finest of lovers.
            Soon Orpheus met Eurydice, and it was love at first sight. Nothing could come between the two lovers as they got married. However, this marriage
            would only last for a short, because while Eurydice was walking through the forest, she was bitten by a venomous snake and was killed. Orpheus was so 
            distraught by this that he sang song after song of his grief and sorrow. These songs were so beautiful that even the gods themselves soon knew 
            of his loss and felt pity for the poor man. 
        </p>
        <p id="secondonmyth">
            It was soon after this period of time that Orpheus decided to take a trip to the underworld in order to free his love from the clutches of Hades.
            Protected by the gods, he was able to safely complete the journey after playing Hades' three headed dog, Cerberus, a song that allowed him to pass.
            He soon arrived in front of Hades himself, along with his wife, Persephone. It was here that Hades nearly struck down the young man as he stood, but 
            Orpheus played him a song so breath-taking that Hades, the king of the underworld, was nearly moved to tears. Along with some convincing from his wife
            Persephone, Hades allowed Orpheus to guide Eurydice back up to the overworld. However, this came with a catch: he could not look back to see if she was 
            really following him, he had to put all the trust he had into Hades, god of death and the underworld. Orpheus agreed.
        </p>
        <p id="thirdonmyth">
            Orpheus began the long and treacherous journey out of the underworld, and although he had his doubts, his love for Eurydice was stronger. Eurydice followed
            close behind him, knowing that her lover was of strong mind, she was elated that he had come to rescue her. As the journey went on, Orpheus began getting
            increasingly worried that Hades had tricked him afterall, he hadn't so much heard a single footstep behind him the whole trip, yet he still carried on, with
            hope on his side he pushed through the doubt. Soon enough the exit was in sight, Eurydice saw it and almost yells in excitment, only steps away she begins to 
            think what the first thing they will do when they escape, will they sing songs together, or maybe even-. In that moment Orpheus lost to the doubts, he turned around.
            For a brief second the lovers got to see each other one last time and soon after Eurydice vanished forever.

        <p id="fourthonmyth">
            It is said today that Orpheus wanders the Earth, singing songs in rememberance and mourning of his lost love.

        <p id="bulletpreface">It is worth mentioning that this is only one of many iterations of this myth. The one the story above is based off of is 
            from <i>Bibliotheca</i> by Pseudo-Apollodorus. Some other notable iterations of the myth include:

        <ul id="bulletpoints">
            <li>Virgil's edition of the legend which first pioneered the ending of the story we know today. <a href="https://classics.domains.skidmore.edu/lit-campus-only/primary/translations/Vergil%20Geo%204%20Orpheus.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" title="Virgil's Take">Link</a></li>
            <li>Plato's edition, who apparently thought very bad of Orpheus, for he gets killed by a woman once returning to the overworld because he denied her. <a href="https://www.plato-dialogues.org/tools/char/orpheus.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" title="Virgil's Take">Link</a></li>
            <li>Ovid's edition, where instead of getting bitten by a snake Eurydice dies from dancing with naiads.  <a href="https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Latin/Metamorph10.php" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" title="Virgil's Take">Link</a></li>
