            <h1>The Myth of Orpheus and Eurydice</h1>
        </div>

        <div class="intro">
            <p id="introHades">The tragic tale of two love birds who were stolen from each other and reunited through pure determination, only to lose everything in the end.
            This classic and eternal story has been passed down for generations and inspired many incredible works, such as a Broadway musical named <i>Hadestown</i>, which can be read about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hadestown" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" title="Read About Hadestown">here</a>.</p>

        <div class="morewriting">
            <p>In a world so grim and hopeless, the tragedy of Orpheus and Eurydice offers us new life and new perspective through their misfortunes.
                Throughout the tradgedy one is able to clearly take away three major elements to potentially improve one's life:
            </p>
            <ol id="numlist">
                <li>Having the strength and courage to fight for someone is worth it and may push you to new heights</li>
                <li>Having trust in not only yourself, but in others around you is key to your success</li>
                <li>Although we may lose those who we love most dear, it is important to not only grief their loss, but also to let them go</li>
            </ol>
        </div>

        <div class="supportive message">
            <p>In this world, life is difficult and unforgiving, and myths like Orpheus and Eurydice reflect that. 
                However, the difference between us and these stories is that we are able to learn from our own faults and 
                the faults of our heros in these stories. They suffer eternally so we might avoid the same fate. For that we should be most thankful.
            </p>
